bridge.py -- persistent Switch 2 Pro Controller -> virtual Xbox 360 pad bridge.

Reads the controller's 64-byte HID input reports, parses Nintendo's custom
layout (mapping.py), and republishes the state as a real driver-level Xbox 360
pad via ViGEmBus (vigem.py) so Dolphin / any game sees a standard XInput pad.

PERSISTENCE GUARANTEE: the virtual pad is created ONCE and held for the entire
life of this process. Nothing -- a controller unplug, a USB power hiccup, a bad
HID read, a transient ViGEm error -- removes the pad or stops the bridge. Only
YOU closing the window (Ctrl+C / close) ends it. While the controller is briefly
away the pad just reads neutral, then input resumes automatically with no need to
touch Dolphin. (As a last resort, if the pad driver itself dies, the bridge
recreates it and tells you to hit Refresh in Dolphin.)

Usage
-----
  python procon2/bridge.py                 # run the bridge
  python procon2/bridge.py --debug         # also print parsed state live
  python procon2/bridge.py --debug-hz 20   # debug print rate (default 10/s)

Stop with Ctrl+C (or just close the window).
