# procon2 — Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller → Windows gamepad bridge

A **native, persistent** Windows app that makes the Switch 2 Pro Controller
(USB `057E:2069`) usable in Dolphin and any game — the reliable replacement for
the browser-based ProCon2Tool, which disconnects when its tab loses focus.

```
Switch 2 Pro (boots ASLEEP)  ->  wake over WinUSB bulk            (winusb.py)
                             ->  read 64-byte HID input reports    (hid.py)
                             ->  parse Nintendo's custom layout     (mapping.py)
                             ->  publish a virtual Xbox 360 pad      (vigem.py / ViGEmBus)
                             ->  Dolphin reads a normal Xbox pad (XInput)
```

Zero third-party Python packages. Pure `ctypes` against the Win32 HID API and
the ViGEmClient DLL. Runs on any CPython including 3.14 — no compiler needed.

## Status (verified on real hardware)

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Wake the controller (it boots **asleep**) over WinUSB bulk → it streams @~250 Hz | ✅ proven (`winusb.py`) |
| Read HID reports via pure ctypes | ✅ proven |
| Virtual Xbox 360 pad via ViGEmBus → readable by XInput | ✅ proven (`selftest_vigem.py`, 7/7) |
| Full pipeline controller → parse → ViGEm → XInput | ✅ proven (`selftest_bridge.py`, 255 rep/s) |
| Auto-reconnect loop **+ auto-wake on every (re)attach** | ✅ built (`bridge.py`) |
| Exact button-bit + stick-byte mapping | ✅ done (`mapping_data.py`) |
| **Rumble**: Dolphin → controller haptics | ✅ HID output report `0x02` (`haptics.py`), safe captured values |
| Working in Dolphin (build 2603a) | ✅ confirmed |

The ViGEmBus driver is already installed on this machine (Nefarius Virtual
Gamepad Emulation Bus 1.21.442.0). `vgamepad` ships **no wheel** for Python 3.14
and its sdist runs an interactive driver installer, so we bundle just its
`ViGEmClient.dll` (see `vendor/`) and wrap it ourselves.

## Report skeleton (reverse engineered)

| Offset | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `0`      | report id (`0x09`) |
| `1`      | frame counter (increments every ~4 ms) |
| `2`      | constant marker (`0x23`) |
| `3,4,5`  | **button bitfields** (all `0x00` when released) |
| `6–15`   | **stick axes** (packed; exact layout being mapped) |
| `16–44`  | IMU (gyro + accel) — ignored for gamepad use |
| `45–63`  | padding (`0x00`) |

## Files

**Runtime (the bridge and its layers):**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bridge.py`         | the app: wake → HID read → parse → virtual pad + rumble back + auto-reconnect |
| `hid.py`            | pure-ctypes Win32 HID layer (enumerate / open / overlapped read+write) |
| `winusb.py`         | native WinUSB bulk **wake** (MI_01) — the controller boots asleep |
| `vigem.py`          | pure-ctypes ViGEmClient wrapper → `X360Pad` (incl. rumble notification) |
| `xinput.py`         | tiny XInput slot reader (tells you which `XInput/N` the pad took) |
| `mapping.py`        | report bytes → logical state; loads `mapping_data.py` if present |
| `mapping_data.py`   | the verified button/stick map |
| `haptics.py`        | **rumble** out — HID output report `0x02`, safe captured haptic payloads |
| `vendor/`           | bundled `ViGEmClient.dll` (+ x86 fallback) and the fetch script |

**Tools & tests (run as needed):**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `procon2_probe.py`  | low-level raw-HID inspector (for re-reverse-engineering) |
| `diag.py`           | live pipeline diagnostic (controller→parse→ViGEm→XInput, per-press) |
| `selftest_vigem.py` | ViGEm → XInput round-trip proof |
| `selftest_bridge.py`| full input-pipeline proof (real controller, ~3 s) |
| `test_rumble.py`    | controller-side rumble smoke test |
| `test_rumble_e2e.py`| full-chain rumble test (simulated Dolphin vibration → controller) |

## Run

```powershell
# everyday: start the bridge, then click Refresh in Dolphin once
python procon2\launch.py            # or "Start (Auto-detect).bat"; auto USB/BT, --debug to watch state

# tests / diagnostics (optional):
python procon2\selftest_vigem.py    # ViGEm -> XInput, expect 7/7 PASS
python procon2\selftest_bridge.py   # full input pipeline, expect "PIPELINE LIVE"
python procon2\test_rumble_e2e.py   # full-chain rumble (hold the controller)
```

## Status — complete

1. ✅ Reverse the report skeleton; confirm the device.
2. ✅ Virtual ViGEm X360 pad, proven via XInput round-trip.
3. ✅ Bridge: wake → read → parse → pad, full pipeline live.
4. ✅ Verified button/stick map (`mapping_data.py`); GL/GR → Z.
5. ✅ Working in Dolphin (build 2603a). Port 1 = `XInput/1/Gamepad` via the saved
   `Switch 2 Pro` GCPad profile.
6. ✅ Reliability: native auto-wake (`winusb.py`) on every (re)attach + USB selective
   suspend disabled → survives drops, never needs the browser tool.
7. ✅ Rumble both ways: Dolphin → pad → controller haptics (`haptics.py`, safe values).

## Daily use

1. Double-click **`Start (Auto-detect).bat`** (in the repo root). Keep the window open.
2. In Dolphin's controller config, click **Refresh** once (so it re-acquires the
   freshly-created pad — the one habit to remember). Then play.

If input ever stops registering, it's almost always the pad being recreated while
Dolphin is open → just hit **Refresh**.
